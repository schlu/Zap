MacRuby application for managing your [Pow](http://pow.cx) symlinks. This is very much a beta project that needs a lot of help. Ideally this project would to become a dev center. So that designers could tail logs, view installed gems, etc.

Current features
----------------
* Symlink Management
* Reveal in Finder
* Open in Browser


Roadmap
-------

All features on the road map have no deadlines. The best way to get a feature implemented is to donate money or implement the feature yourself.

* Add Tests
* Show ruby version and gemset
* Show installed gems
* Add default management once [default](https://github.com/37signals/pow/commit/2dc556a9b9cbfa9b799d4d804f5f6a32cae78fd3) functionality gets built in
